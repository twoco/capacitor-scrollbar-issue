# Scrollbar Issue

https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor/issues/5540

This project was simple created via `ionic start`.
No special changes. Just some content on home page to overflow for scroll.

You can see that Capacitor (and Cordova btw) don't display scrollbars like browsers (including mobile) do.
We need an option to enable scrollbars.

Just run on e.g. Android with `npm run android` or `npm start` to run on desktop.
